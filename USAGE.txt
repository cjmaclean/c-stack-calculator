stack-calc.exe [arguments]

Runs the arguments as stack commands:
+ removes and adds the two values on top of the stack
  the result is pushed on top of the stack 
- similar but subtracts
x similar but multiplies
p pops and displays the top of the stack


example:
stack-calc.exe 2 15 3 x + p

first this puts 2, 15 and 3 on the stack.
x multiplies 3 and 15 on top of the stack, resulting in stack:
2 45
+ adds 2 and 45 on stack, resulting in stack: 47
p pops and displays the 47

example: 
stack-calc.exe + 2 15 3 + + 15 3 - 15 3 x p p p p 8 p p
